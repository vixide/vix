# Org

A pragmatic subset of [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) for editing `.org`-style
outlines. The logic lives in the pure `crate::org` module (unit-tested); the
top-level **Org** menu wires it to the active buffer at the cursor line.

This is intentionally *not* a complete Org implementation — it covers the basics:
headline structure, TODO/checkbox toggling, folding, and lightweight export.

## Concepts

- **Headline**: a line of one or more leading `*` followed by a space
  (`* Top`, `** Child`). The star count is the level.
- **Subtree**: a headline plus all following lines up to the next headline of the
  same or higher level.
- **Drawer**: a `:NAME:` header line (e.g. `:PROPERTIES:`, `:LOGBOOK:`) through
  a matching `:END:` line. The lines between hold the drawer's contents (property
  lines such as `:foo: 123`).

## Drawer folding

With the cursor on a drawer header line — one that starts and ends with a colon,
like `:PROPERTIES:` — pressing **Tab** folds the drawer, hiding its body (through
`:END:`) the way code folding hides a block. The header stays visible with a
trailing `...` to signal the hidden content; pressing **Tab** again on the header
unfolds it. Folding is view-only — it never edits the buffer text. On any other
line Tab indents as usual. The foldable range is computed by `org::drawer_range`
(unit-tested); the editor's `toggle_manual_fold` performs the fold.

```
* Name              * Name
:properties:   Tab  :properties:...
:foo: 123     ───▶
:end:
```

## Menu

The **Org** menu (`Alt+O`):

| Item | Action | Effect |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Capture → Anything… | `org.capture` | Open a single-line prompt, pre-filled from the `org_anything_capture_template` setting; the text is inserted as a `* TODO` headline at the cursor. |
| Capture → Contact… | `org.contacts.new` | Prompt for a name and insert an org-contacts entry (moved here from Org → Contacts). |
| Capture → Todo… | `org.capture_todo` | Open a multiline editing area (Alt+Enter = newline), pre-filled from the `org_todo_capture_template` setting (default `* TODO `); the text is inserted verbatim at the cursor. |
| Cycle Visibility (Fold) | `org.cycle_visibility` | Fold/unfold at the cursor (reuses the editor fold toggle). |
| Headline → Promote | `org.promote` | Remove one `*` from every headline in the subtree (refused at level 1). |
| Headline → Demote | `org.demote` | Add one `*` to every headline in the subtree. |
| Headline → Move Subtree Up | `org.move_up` | Swap the subtree with the previous sibling. |
| Headline → Move Subtree Down | `org.move_down` | Swap the subtree with the next sibling. |
| Cycle TODO | `org.cycle_todo` | Cycle the headline keyword: none → `TODO` → `DONE` → none. |
| Mark Done with Note… | `org.close_note` | Prompt for a closing note (multiline; Alt+Enter = newline), then mark the headline `DONE`, stamp `CLOSED: [now]` under it, and log the note into its `:LOGBOOK:` drawer. |
| Toggle Checkbox | `org.toggle_checkbox` | Toggle a list item's `[ ]` ⇄ `[x]`. |
| Update Statistics | `org.update_statistics` | Recompute every checkbox parent state and `[/]`/`[%]` cookie in the buffer. |
| Clock In | `org.clock_in` | Insert an open `CLOCK: [now]` entry at the cursor (local time). |
| Clock Out | `org.clock_out` | Close the most recent open `CLOCK:` entry with the end time and `=> H:MM` duration. |
| Agenda Tracker | `org.agenda` | Reindex, then compile `DEADLINE:`/`SCHEDULED:` items and `TODO` headlines from every `.org` file into a single dated **interactive** agenda buffer (read-only; `t` cycles the task under the cursor in its source file). |
| Time Tracker | `org.time_report` | Sum each headline's `CLOCK:` durations in the active buffer into a time-report table. |
| Export → Markdown | `org.export_markdown` | Convert the buffer to Markdown in a new tab. |
| Export → HTML | `org.export_html` | Convert the buffer to a standalone HTML document in a new tab. |

Agenda and Time Tracker output open in a new buffer. The pure builders
(`org::agenda`, `org::time_report`) are unit tested; `CLOCK:` durations are read
from the `=> H:MM` totals Org writes.

Structure commands operate on the headline/line under the cursor; the cursor
follows a moved subtree. When a command does not apply (e.g. the cursor is not on
a headline, or there is no sibling to swap with), the status bar says so.

### Emacs chords

Under the **Emacs** keymap, the familiar Org `C-c` chords are wired to these
commands (discoverable via the which-key popup after `C-c`):

| Chord | Action | Effect |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| `C-c C-t` | `org.cycle_todo` | Cycle the headline's TODO keyword. |
| `C-u C-c C-t` | `org.close_note` | Mark the headline `DONE` and record a closing note + `CLOSED:` timestamp (the universal-argument variant). |
| `C-c C-c` | `org.ctrl_c_ctrl_c` | Context action: toggle the checkbox on the cursor line, else recompute statistics cookies. |

`C-u` is the Emacs universal argument; it applies to the next command and is
cancelled by any key other than the `C-c` prefix.

### Interactive agenda

**Agenda Tracker** opens a read-only buffer. Pressing `t` on a task line cycles
that task's TODO state (`org::cycle_todo`) directly in its **source `.org` file
on disk**, reloads any open, clean buffer for that file, and rebuilds the agenda
in place (keeping the cursor line) — mirroring Emacs `org-agenda-todo`. The pure
`org::agenda_items` records each entry's source line, and `org::render_agenda`
returns both the buffer text and a line→item map so the host can act on the line
under the cursor. Marking a task `DONE` with a note (`C-u C-c C-t`) uses
`org::close_headline`, which forces the keyword to `DONE`, inserts (or refreshes)
a `CLOSED: [now]` planning line, and logs the note into a `:LOGBOOK:` drawer as
`- Note taken on [now] \\` + the indented body.

### Checkbox & statistics cookies

A checkbox list item with sub-items reflects their state: all children checked →
`[X]`, none → `[ ]`, otherwise → `[-]` (partial). A *statistics cookie* —
`[/]`/`[n/m]` (fraction) or `[%]`/`[n%]` (percent) — written anywhere in a
headline or parent list item counts its children:

```
* Organize Party [33%]
** TODO Call people [1/2]
*** TODO Peter
*** DONE Sarah
** TODO Buy food
** DONE Talk to neighbor
```

A headline cookie counts child checkboxes if its body has top-level checkboxes,
otherwise direct child TODO headlines. The `:COOKIE_DATA:` property resolves the
ambiguity (`checkbox` or `todo`); adding `recursive` counts TODO entries in the
whole subtree, not just direct children. Cookies and parent checkboxes are
recomputed automatically after **Toggle Checkbox** / **Cycle TODO**, and on
demand via **Update Statistics**. The pure builder is `org::update_statistics`.

## Roam

The **Org → Roam** submenu brings [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/)-style
networked, Zettelkasten note-taking to a directory of `.org` files. A **node** is
an `.org` file with an `:ID:` property and a `#+title:`; nodes link to one another
with `[[id:<id>][Title]]` links, forming a graph. The pure logic lives in the
unit-tested `crate::roam` module; the host wires it to prompts and the filesystem.

| Item | Action | Effect |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Find Node… | `roam.node_find` | Prompt for a title; open the matching node, or create `<slug>.org` (with a fresh `:ID:`) and open it. |
| Insert Node Link… | `roam.node_insert` | Prompt for a title; insert an `[[id:…][Title]]` link at the cursor, creating the node file (without leaving the current buffer) if new. |
| Random Node | `roam.node_random` | Jump to a randomly chosen node. |
| Capture Node… | `roam.capture` | Prompt for a title and create/open a new node. |
| Backlinks | `roam.backlinks` | Compile a buffer of *linked* references (files linking to the active node's `:ID:`) and *unlinked* references (files mentioning its title). |
| Dailies → Today | `roam.dailies_today` | Open (creating if needed) today's daily note `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.org`. |
| Dailies → Capture Today… | `roam.dailies_capture` | Append a `* HH:MM …` entry to today's daily note. |
| Dailies → Go to Date… | `roam.dailies_date` | Prompt for a `YYYY-MM-DD` date and open that daily note. |
| Metadata → Add Tag… | `roam.tag_add` | Add a tag to the node's `#+filetags:` line. |
| Metadata → Add Alias… | `roam.alias_add` | Append a quoted alias to the `:ROAM_ALIASES:` property. |
| Metadata → Add Ref… | `roam.ref_add` | Append a URL / cite key to the `:ROAM_REFS:` property. |
| Graph | `roam.graph` | Build a Mermaid `flowchart` of all nodes and `[[id:…]]` links into a new buffer. |
| Sync Database | `roam.db_sync` | Re-index the project and open a sortable table of every node (title, file, tags). |

Nodes live in the project root; daily notes live in `daily/`. There is no
persistent database — *Sync Database* simply re-scans the project's `.org` files,
matching org-roam's `org-roam-db-sync` semantics in a stateless way.

## Node

The **Org → Node** submenu brings [org-node](https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node)
functionality — a fast, ID-based take on networked notes where a **node** is
either a whole file *or* any subtree carrying an `:ID:`. It shares the on-disk
format with Roam (`:ID:`, `:ROAM_ALIASES:`, `:ROAM_REFS:`, `[[id:…]]` links), so
the two coexist. Find / Insert Link / Random / Backlinks reuse the shared node
machinery; the rest are org-node's distinctive operations.

| Item | Action | Effect |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Find Node… | `roam.node_find` | Open or create a node by title. |
| Insert Link… | `roam.node_insert` | Insert an `[[id:…]]` link to a node. |
| Insert Transclusion… | `node.insert_transclusion` | Insert a `#+transclude: [[id:…]]` directive for a node (created if new). |
| Random Node | `roam.node_random` | Jump to a random node. |
| Nodeify Entry | `node.nodeify` | Give the headline at the cursor an `:ID:`, making it a (subtree) node. |
| Extract Subtree to Node | `node.extract_subtree` | Cut the subtree at the cursor into its own file node, leaving an `[[id:…]]` link behind. |
| Backlinks | `roam.backlinks` | Show linked + unlinked references to the active node. |
| List Dead Links | `node.dead_links` | Report `[[id:…]]` links whose target ID is not declared by any node. |
| Rename File by Title | `node.rename_by_title` | Rename the active file to the slug of its `#+title:`. |
| Rebuild Cache | `node.reset` | Re-scan the project's nodes (the stateless `org-mem-reset` equivalent). |

*Nodeify* and *Extract Subtree* embody org-node's headline-as-node model;
extraction promotes the subtree's nested headlines so they sit at the top level
of the new file. Pure helpers (`roam::nodeify`, `roam::dead_links`,
`roam::transclusion`, `roam::all_ids`) are unit-tested.

## Contacts

The **Org → Contacts** submenu brings
[org-contacts](https://github.com/doomelpa/org-contacts)-style contact management
to Org files. A contact is a headline (its text is the name) whose `:PROPERTIES:`
drawer holds `EMAIL` / `PHONE` / `ADDRESS` / `BIRTHDAY` / `NICKNAME` / `NOTE`.

| Item | Action | Effect |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| New Contact… | `org.contacts.new` | Prompt for a name; insert a contact headline + property-drawer skeleton at the cursor. |
| Find Contacts | `org.contacts.find` | Compile a name/email/phone table of every contact in the project's `.org` files. |
| Insert Field → Email/Phone/Address/Birthday/Nickname/Note | `org.contacts.field.*` | Insert a `:KEY:` property line into the current entry's drawer. |
| Birthdays | `org.contacts.birthdays` | List contacts that have a `BIRTHDAY`, sorted by date. |
| Export to vCard | `org.contacts.vcard` | Convert all contacts to a vCard 3.0 buffer. |

Pure logic (parse, directory, birthdays, vCard) lives in the unit-tested
`crate::org_contacts` module.

## Insertion

Org *content* insertion (snippets, inline markers, blocks) lives under
**Tools → Insert → Org / Markers / Begin-End** — see
[`crates/vix-org/spec/insert-org.md`](../tools/insert/org.md).

## Export mapping (pragmatic)

- Headlines → `#`×level (Markdown) / `<h1..6>` (HTML); `#+title:` → top heading.
- Inline: `*bold*`, `/italic/`, `_underline_`, `+strike+`, `~code~`, `=verbatim=`,
  and `[[url][desc]]` / `[[url]]` links.
- Bullet lists → Markdown `-` / HTML `<ul><li>`. Block delimiters (`#+BEGIN_…`)
  are dropped, their inner text kept.
